#### Adding Files
In order to add files to the repository, and to ensure that the master does not get messed up, you must first create what is known as a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/). In order to make sure that the admins see your request, there are several rules that you have to follow before it will ever get merged.
- Add a reasonable amount of comments; If no one understands why the change is important then there is very little chance of it ever happening
